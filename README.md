<h1>Hello Free Code Camp</h1>
<h3>API Key</h3>
<p>For this project I used an API key in a seperate file called key.js. For this app to work, please include your own API key. I used a variable called key in my key.js file.... Ex: var key = "hfwgowrghw86383fhflw". The folder is accessed on line 29 of index.html. The key variable is on line 23 of script.js.</p>
